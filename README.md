This assignment is a weather application that reads a .csv file to get weather information about every day in a year and then displays important 
information to the user by month. It has a button that on click generates a new file with randomized data based on the data from:

that regenerates the the file as with new randomized information. You can also press a button to select a .csv, which afterward sends you to a 
page that displays important information like average temperature, whether the temperature is warm, cold, or hot, and the number of rainy days, 
all by month. The user can then use buttons to look through the desired data for each month. This program leverages modern tools of Java such as 
lamdas, records, and enhanced switch statements to implement all the features, some of these tools I am using for the first time in this program. 
This was also my first time dealing with selecting files and having to organize input from a file in java.
